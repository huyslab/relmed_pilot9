	" 		<p><b>Who is conducting this research study?</b></p>  " + 
	" 		<p>  " + 
	" 		This research is being conducted by the Division of Psychiatry and the Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry  " + 
	" 		and Ageing Research at University College London, London, UK. The lead researchers for this project is  " + 
	" 		<a href=\"mailto:q.huys@ucl.ac.uk\">Dr Quentin Huys</a>. This study has been approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee  " +

	"  " + 
	" 		<p><b>What is the purpose of this study?</b></p>  " + 
	" 		<p>  " + 
	" 		We are interested in how the adult brain controls learning and decision-making. This research aims to provide  " + 
	" 		insights into how the healthy brain works to help us understand the causes of a number of different medical  " + 
	" 		conditions.  " + 
	" 		</p>  " + 
	"  " + 
	" 		<p><b>Who can participate in the study?</b></p>  " + 
	" 		<p>  " + 
	" 		You must be 18 or over to participate in this study.  " + 
	"  " + 
	" 		<p><b>What will happen to me if I take part?</b></p>  " + 
	" 		<p>  " + 
	" 		You will play one online computer game consisting of two parts, which will last approximately "+dur_experiment+" minutes. You will receive  " + 
	" 		at least Â£"+base_payment+" for helping us out with an opportunity for an additional bonus depending on your choices. The amount may vary with the responses you make in the games.  " + 
	" 		Remember, you are free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason.  " + 
	" 		</p>  " + 
	"  " + 
	" 		<p><b>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</b></p>  " + 
	" 		<p>  " + 
	" 		The task will you complete does not pose any known risks.  " + 
	" 		</p>  " + 
	"  " + 
	" 		<p><b>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</b></p>  " + 
	" 		<p>  " + 
	" 		While there are no immediate benefits to taking part, your participation in this research will help us  " + 
	" 		understand how people make decisions and this could have benefits for our understanding of mental health problems.  " +
